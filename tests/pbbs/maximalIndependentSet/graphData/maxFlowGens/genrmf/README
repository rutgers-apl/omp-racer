GENRMF -- Maxflow generator in DIMACS format.

This generator produces the RMFGEN networks developed by 
 Goldfarb and Grigoriadis (see ``A computational comparison of the Dinic
  and Network Simplex methods for maximum flow,'' Annals of Operations 
  Research 13 (1988), pp 83--123.

Compilation: Get all the files. Type make.

Usage: genrmf [-out out_file]
              -a frame_size -b depth
              -c1 cap_range1 -c2 cap_range2

	       Here without the -out option the generator will
		write to stdout.

		The generated network is as follows:
			It has b pieces of frames of size (a x a).
			(So alltogether the number of vertices is a*a*b)
			
			In each frame all the vertices are connected with 
			their neighbours. (forth and back)
			In addition the vertices of a frame are connected
			one to one with the vertices of next frame using 
			a random permutation of those vertices.

			The source is the lower left vertex of the first frame,
			the sink is the upper right vertex of the b'th frame. 
               
			The capacities are randomly chosen integers
			from the range of (c1, c2) in the case of 
                        interconnecting edges, and c2 * a * a for 
                        the in-frame edges.
